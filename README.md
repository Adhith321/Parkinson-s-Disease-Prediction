Parkinson's Disease Prediction
This repository provides a comparative analysis of three machine learning models – Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Naive Bayes (NB) – for predicting Parkinson’s disease. The goal is to identify which model offers the best accuracy, reliability, and efficiency for detecting early signs of Parkinson’s using clinical and vocal features.

Overview
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder affecting movement and speech. Accurate early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project explores three different supervised learning algorithms to classify whether a person is likely to have Parkinson’s disease.

Models Used
Support Vector Machine (SVM):

Works well with high-dimensional data, such as vocal and motor features.
Uses a hyperplane to classify data into Parkinson’s and non-Parkinson’s categories.
Known for robustness against overfitting, especially in complex datasets.
Random Forest (RF):

An ensemble learning method using multiple decision trees.
Aggregates the predictions of individual trees, increasing accuracy and reducing the risk of overfitting.
Suitable for handling imbalanced datasets and feature interactions.
Naive Bayes (NB):

Based on Bayes’ theorem and assumes independence between predictors.
Fast and computationally efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications.
Performs well with small datasets and is robust to noisy data.
Dataset
The dataset includes features derived from vocal, motor, and demographic data. [Provide a link to the dataset if it's public, e.g., UCI Parkinson’s dataset].
